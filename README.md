# ðŸ“ƒ Resume Keyword Optimizer

# ðŸŽ¯ Goal

Applying for jobs is already stressful - but getting past the **Applicant Tracking Systems** many companies use can be an invisible obstacle. These systems often filter out resumes that don't match enough keywords from the job description, meaning many qualified candidates with big potential are never seen and judged by a human.

**Resume Keyword Optimizer** was built to tackle this problem.
This web-based tool helps job seekers improve their chances of getting interviews by:

- Identifying **missing keywords** in their resumes based on a specific job description.
- Giving actionable feedback to help tailor applications for each job.
- Making ATS optimization more transparent, accessible, and less time-consuming.

Whether you're applying for your first internship or switching careers, this tool is designed to be simple, fast, and genuinely useful.
